# vim-sh-heredoc-highlighting
This vim plugin enables syntax highlighting for code snippets in shell heredocs.

It will highlight shell, perl and python snippets when it sees heredocs
delimited by the markers SHELL, PERL or PYTHON respectively. You should be able
to extend this to whatever you want very easily by modifying
`after/syntax/sh/heredoc-sh.vim` following the pattern that's apparent.
